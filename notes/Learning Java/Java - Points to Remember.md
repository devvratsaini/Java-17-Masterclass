# Java - Points to Remember

### Instance Variable

- A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method - Instance Variable
- Its value is instance-specific and is not shared among instances.

### Static Variable

- You can create a single copy of the static variable that is shared it among all the instances of the class.
- Memory allocation for static variables happens only once when the class is loaded in the memory.
- It cannot be local.

### Intro to Data Types

- Primitive : boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float, double.
- Non-primitive : Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.

### Keywords

- 
1. **abstract:** Java abstract keyword is used to declare an abstract class. An abstract class can provide the implementation of the interface. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
2. **continue:** Java continue keyword is used to continue the loop. It continues the current flow of the program and skips the remaining code at the specified condition.
3. **enum:** Java enum keyword is used to define a fixed set of constants. Enum constructors are always private or default.
4. **final:** Java final keyword is used to indicate that a variable holds a constant value. It is used with a variable. It is used to restrict the user from updating the value of the variable.
5. **finally:** Java finally keyword indicates a block of code in a try-catch structure. This block is always executed whether an exception is handled or not.
6. **implements:** Java implements keyword is used to implement an interface.
7. **instanceof:** Java instanceof keyword is used to test whether the object is an instance of the specified class or implements an interface.
8. **native:** Java native keyword is used to specify that a method is implemented in native code using JNI (Java Native Interface).
9. **static:** Java static keyword is used to indicate that a variable or method is a class method. The static keyword in Java is mainly used for memory management.
10. **strictfp:** Java strictfp is used to restrict the floating-point calculations to ensure portability.
11. **super:** Java super keyword is a reference variable that is used to refer to parent class objects. It can be used to invoke the immediate parent class method.
12. **synchronized:** Java synchronized keyword is used to specify the critical sections or methods in multithreaded code.
13. **transient:** Java transient keyword is used in serialization. If you define any data member as transient, it will not be serialized.
14. **volatile:** Java volatile keyword is used to indicate that a variable may change asynchronously.

### Control Statements

1. Decision Making statements
    - if statements
    - switch statement
2. Loop statements
    - do while loop
    - while loop
    - for loop
    - for-each loop
3. Jump statements
    - break statement
    - continue statement

### OOP Concepts

- Object
- Class
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation

Apart from these concepts, there are some other terms which are used in Object-Oriented design:

- Coupling
- Cohesion
- Association
- Aggregation
- Composition

### [ArrayList](ArrayList%20f9e6210cb66e4e91bb48718df6782863.md)

- Java ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements.
- It is like an array, but there is no size limit.
- We can add or remove elements anytime. So, it is much more flexible than the traditional array.
- It is found in the java.util package.
