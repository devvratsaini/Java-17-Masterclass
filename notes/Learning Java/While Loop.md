    - **Step 1:** Write a method `isEvenNumber` to determine whether a number is even or not. The method should return either `true` or `false`. Use this method to print the even numbers between 5 and 20 using a while loop.
    - **Step 2:** Make it also record the total number of even numbers it has found. Break out of the loop once 5 even numbers are found. Finally, display the total number of odd and even numbers found.
